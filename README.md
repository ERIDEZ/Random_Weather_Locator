# Random Weather Locator

## By Erick Hernandez

API for Cities and Weather project 

In this project, I was able to demonstrate how to extract information from certain websites and shape it in order to conduct an analysis of its composition.

First, I needed to download a random set of cities coordinates and identify their country and geographical location. With the help of Pandas DataFrames, I could generate random coordinates, look for the nearest city using Cities module and performing a custom API call with OpenWeather servers.

After that, a function localizing hotels in selected cities with specific weather conditions was made, creating markers placed on top of a Google Map.
