API for Weather and Vacation challenge

In this challenge, I was able to demonstrate how to extract information from certain websites and shape it in order to conduct an analysis of its composition.

First, I needed to download a random set of cities coordinates and identify their country and geographical location.

After that, I had to clean my DataFrame so I could work with real data.

With this in mind, I could locate the cities with a heatmap and later on, perform another API call for localizing hotels in randomly selected cities.
